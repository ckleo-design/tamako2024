The health of the hens that lay these eggs is a top priority, with regular vaccinations and strict salmonella checks on their feed. Throughout the production process, strict measures are implemented to avoid any contamination.<br /><br />So, when you eat a Japanese egg, you can be confident it's of the highest quality.</p>

                            <p class="l-factors__inner__block__content--detail">Japanese eggs are packed with essential nutrients like protein, potassium, and vitamins A, D, and B. They're also an excellent source of DHA, omega-3 fatty acids, lutein, and iron, making them a nutritional powerhouse. There's a reason why eggs are such a popular breakfast item. After a night's rest, consuming eggs mildly increases your body temperature. This acts as a natural stimulant that helps to jumpstart your energy levels for the day ahead.</p>

                            <p class="l-factors__inner__block__content--detail">Japanese eggs set a high standard for freshness and safety as they remain good for 21 days from when they're produced. In Japan, eggs play an essential ingredient in the kitchen. This drives farmers to constantly refine their production methods, and the cultural emphasis on quality has resulted in eggs that are outstanding.<br /><br />Japanese hens consume a controlled diet of premium grains and vital nutrients. The hens lay eggs with yolks so golden and bright, they could rival the sun. These eggs also have an exceptionally savory taste, and thanks to efficient distribution, they reach stores quickly after being laid, ensuring you get that just-laid freshness with every crack of the shell.</p>

                <p class="l-kewpie--intro">Since the beginning, we have adhered to the concept of "market fundamentalism". <br />In Japan, approximately 330 eggs are consumed annually per person. This is a higher rate of consumption in the world and so eggs are an essential part of the diet in Japan. There is also a "raw food culture" such as "TKG (egg over rice)". That is why we are consistent in keeping high levels of safety and quality of chicken eggs. In addition, the egg-related business must be a business that goes together with nature. It is necessary to be an eco-friendly business model. For example, the use of renewable energies and the use of domestic rice as feedstuffs. We will continue to work on business models that are green and eco-friendly.</p>
